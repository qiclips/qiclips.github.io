##  Why this exists you ask?
1. IDK, I just felt like wasting my time doing nothing (_you should try that too, pretty relaxing TBH_) 😌 
2. My all time favourite [Jekyll Theme Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) has the feature to add LQIP and it looks hella awesome, go check it out 🚀 
3. Couldn't find any free generators online, and I got tired of ChatGPT hallucinating 🤖 

## How to use (for noobs)
1. No idea!!! I am NooB 😵 
2. Well, needs 🐍 installed on your system if you are in the 🪟 Cult, and if you're in the 🐧 Cult 👀 GG, tho your version could be backdated with no nooby way to upgrade it.
3.`git clone https://github.com/SoumyaK4/LQIP-base64.git` then `cd LQIP-base64` and just use _VSCodium_ to run `python generator.py`
4. Rest of the guide is written on the terminal 💻 ohhh myyyyyy zshhhhhhhhhhh

## Setting up on a Serious Note 😠 
1. Make sure you have Python Installed, atleast 3.10
2. `pip install` these: `pillow` & `pyperclip`
3. `git clone https://github.com/SoumyaK4/LQIP-base64.git` > `cd LQIP-base64` 

## Running 🏃🏽 
1. Run `python generator.py` then select `VG.jpeg`
2. And you'll see ✨
